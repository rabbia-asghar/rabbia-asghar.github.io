## About Me
I am a researcher in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence specializing in perception and motion prediction for autonomous systems. My expertise lies at the intersection of multi-sensor fusion, probabilistic modeling, and deep learning, with a specific focus on robots operating in complex, shared human environments. During my Ph.D., I developed uncertainty-aware motion forecasting methods by integrating probabilistic Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps with deep learning methods, providing a holistic and robust representation of scene evolution. Moving forward, I am dedicated to developing robust navigation and decision-making systems capable of addressing the inherent complexities of real-world environments and human-robot interaction.
